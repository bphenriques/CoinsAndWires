# CoinsAndWires

project.lisp was developed by me two other collegues. We implemented a minimax-algorithm with alfa-beta prunning plus some heuristics. In the source code is shown how we developed a timely constrained search.


 The professor gave us a supporting file however I can not make available the source code publicly. For the sake of completeness I putted the methods names and the comments.
